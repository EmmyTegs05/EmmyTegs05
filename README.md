## 👨‍💻 About Me
Cybersecurity Engineer with a profound interest in Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration testing and a dedication to solving complex problems. I’ve worked with security teams to secure large-scale systems in both government and enterprise environments.

## 🎯 Objective
Growing up, I witnessed technology's transformative power and its vulnerabilities without proper security. This personal experience fueled my career transition from physics to cybersecurity, with a specific goal of joining a Red Team operation as a Senior Penetration Tester.
